# Vessel_Replenishment
It is to wrangle Shopify data to create the reporting tables for Vessel Replenishment and Retail Scorecard.

Getting familiar with Shopify data by deep diving into the API documentation. I created the table relations and create the backend code for reporting usage.
It's for both Vessel Replenishment and Retail Scorecard usage. To better monitor the real-time inventory data and replenish it in time.
Also to understand the Day of Supply in different level of details, MSA, vessel, etc.
